> New repos no longer get these defaults and we are no longer adding these labels. However, we do need the profile image still and existing projects have these templates.

# Repo defaults

GitHub templates for consistency across projects.

## Set repo labels

1. Add labels to `labels.json`
2. Run `deno run --allow-read --allow-net labeller.ts`
